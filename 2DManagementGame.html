							<h1>2D Resource Management Game</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/resourceManagementScreenGrab.jpg" alt="" ></span>
							<p>This is a game that I worked on as a prototype project for my final course in college. This was my second game made in Unity. This game is a mix of genres that combine resource management with base building, tower defence and real time strategy. In the game you harvest the resources around you to expand and defend against an oncoming wave of enemies that want to destroy your core. Build turrets and walls around your base in order to defend yourself.</p>
							<p>In the vision for this full game you would go through levels where you build up your bases. In a fully realized version of this game, you would gradually unlock more resources to manage along with new structures you can use these resources to build. Combining all of this would create a challenging strategy game where you must plan out and manage yourself very carefully.</p>
							<p>Making this project was extremely fun and rewarding as I challenged myself to learn much more about C# and Functions in Unity. Making this required much more and much harder code where I interweave game systems to create a cohesive experience. Making this as good as I could meant that I have had to learn how to overcome much more complex logic in order to get a task done in a way that is resource efficient when it comes to the computer running the programs.</p>
							<p>During development for this project, I had to learn and implement much more complex ideas and features than previous projects: </p>
							<ul>
							<li>AI pathfinding and targeting- before this project I had zero experience with programming AI pathfinding. However, by experimenting and researching I was able to program and implement A* pathfinding for my enemies in the game.</li>
							<li>C#- I had once again greatly expanded on my knowledge and expertise when it came to C# pathfinding due to this project. Through this project I have been able to become much better and more efficient when programming and understanding logic is C#.</li>
							<li>Complex Array structures- For this project I had to construct complex array structures that I could use to store information in the form of a grid which is then used as the backbone for my building system and my pathfinding.</li>
							<li>Enemy AI Targeting. </li>
							<li>Complex reactive UI. </li>
							<li>A building system. </li>
							<li>More complex Unity features(such as raycast, or overlapBox).</li>
							</ul>
